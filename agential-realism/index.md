# Managing Agency in Hyperreality is a Pscyhotechnology

This is part 4 of a series. Part 1: H[ow Science and Postmodernism Interrelate](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsulphuroxide.medium.com%2Fhow-science-and-postmodernism-interrelate-84ae97f388b0). Part 2: [From Postmodernism to Metamodernism](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsulphuroxide.medium.com%2Ffrom-postmodernism-to-metamodernism-8c1c3ec8a426). Part 3: [Conspiracy Theories, Ideology, and Metaphysics in the Metamodern Era](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsulphuroxide.medium.com%2Fconspiracy-theories-and-metaphysics-in-the-metamodern-era-89457343faf8).

This essay has been a long time coming. I will try and keep this as light as possible but it is a heavy topic.  This topic has roots in a combination of post-structuralism and philosophy of science. This essay is in three sections, each of which starts with a description of a domain, a first sub-section that describes the domain that is named by the section, and then a sub-section that describes how to navigate that domain.  There may be a fourth sub-section that describes how to further manipulate the domain.

Each of the domains overlap, but develop differently, as each domain builds upon the next, from a consideration of the structuring relationships (which can be causal or conceptual), to one of human experience then to assessment of how we navigate that experience.

Rather than follow a more traditional narrative, which has tropes to set up beginning, middle and conclusion, I've adopted an outline format, reminiscent of Spinoza's [The Ethics](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3800/3800-h/3800-h.htm) or Wittgenstein's [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740-pdf.pdf).  A difference here is that I am not seeking to lay axial-groundrules and then build up relationships ontop of those rules.  The three sections are not truly mutually exclusive as each overlaps and refers back to previous sections.

Instead, I am offering this list so that you can sleep how each of the parent and child sections interrelate, with the child sections showing variations/directions on how to understand the parent section.

There's quite a few major takeaways, but one is to challenge a very basic idea: what is nature. Here's two takeaways in list format.

&emsp; - To grok this challenge, you need to consider the "cut" between nature/artificiality. Rethinking this cut requires that we rethink our metaphysical baggage, something we all have, even if you do not recognize how you use metaphysics. Essentially rejecting metaphysics means recognizing a kind of transcendental idealism that begs to be considered as absolute/a-contextual.

&emsp; While you look over this extended outline you will have many opportunities for creating metaphysical structures, often at the expense of otherstanding other structures.

&emsp; - Rejecting modernist ideas include forgoing that objects have static properties that are expressed as some kind of inner core (scientific essentialism). One example of scientific essentialism is that people will consider a person's DNA (or a race of people) as the core of who they are through and through, along with a set of features that they cannot help but be.  Forgoing this idea can lead to understanding how other aspects have influence, other than culture or DNA.

At the end, I hope you will understand when to apply metaphysics and when to eschew it.

An additional takeaway is to see how scientific essentialism is a confusion between cause and effect, something that also confuses us when we try and make sense of our everyday lives.


This essay is a mix of science and philosophy, but at its core, I am not seeking an ivory tower examination of Truth, but a coming to terms of the very concepts we use daily to make sense of our lives in our morality, our politics, and our ethics as we co-create our shared lifeworld.

Speaking of co-creation, I offer heavy thanks for Ahti Ahde for his friendship and his input, for this would be a very different essay if he did not share his deep insights with all of us.
