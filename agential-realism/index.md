Managing Agency in Hyperreality is a Pscyhotechnology.

This essay has been a long time coming. I will try and keep this as light as possible but the topic has roots in a combination of post-structuralism and philosophy of science. This essay is split into three sections, each of which starts with a description of a domain, a first sub-section that describes the domain that is named by the section, and then a sub-section that describes how to navigate that domain.

Each of the domains overlap, but develop differently, as each domain builds upon the next, going from a framing of causation, to one of human experience then to assessment of how we navigate that experience.

Essentially I start by challenging a very basic idea: what is nature. In particular, the "cut" between nature/artificiality. Rethinking this cut requires that we rethink our metaphysical baggage, something we all have, even if you do not recognize how you use metaphysics. Some conceptual baggage includes

- rejecting metaphysics as a kind of transcendental idealism that begs to be considered as absolute/a-contextual 

&emsp; and

- rejecting the modernist idea that objects have static properties that are expressed as some kind of inner core (scientific essentialism). One example of scientific essentialism is that people will consider a person's DNA (or a race of people) as the core of who they are through and through, along with a set of features that they cannot help but be.

At the end, I hope you will understand when to apply metaphysics and when to eschew it.

In a profound manner, we shall see that scientific essentialism is a confusion between cause and effect, something that also confuses us when we try and make sense of our everyday lives.

This essay is a mix of science and philosophy, but at its core, I am not seeking an ivory tower examination of Truth, but a coming to terms of the very concepts we use daily to make sense of our lives in our morality, our politics, and our ethics as we co-create our shared lifeworld.

Speaking of co-creation, I offer heavy thanks for Ahti Ahde for his friendship and his input, for this would be a very different essay if he did not share his deep insights with all of us.
