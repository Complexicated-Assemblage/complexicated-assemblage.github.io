# 3 Psychotechnology

## 3.1 Definition of Pscyhotechnology.

### &emsp; 3.1.1 Attention as Function of Psychotechnology.

    The first two subsections focus on knowledge as fitting a pre-defined type.  The last two subsections consider that knowledge can be of states are not pre-given.

## 3.2 Hyperreality as Epistemology.

### &emsp; 3.2.1 Games and the control of context

&emsp; See Background of Non-interference #background

### &emsp; 3.2.2 Industry defined contexts

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.2.1 Games (that people play)

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.2.2 Fan jargon, sub cultures

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.2.3 Sorting types

### &emsp; 3.2.3 Science type domain genres

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.3.1 Big data, sociology

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.3.2 science expertiments and hypothesis.  See Deleuzian encounter; could repeat circular...

### &emsp; 3.2.4 Epistemology and Attention focusing

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.1 Wisdom, Vervaeke to Heidegger (opposite of 3.2.1)

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2 Requires Genres (including 3.2.2)

##### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1 genre as baseline for sense/ narratives and forms.

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The first half involves the agencies of the intra-agencies (performance and experimentation) require some mastery of craftsmanship.  But the second half (language and genre forming) are centered on the symbolic layer for determining the direction of development.

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.1 performance arts, the media... social media where genre opens up to other agencies...

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.2 experimental art, craftsmanship (da vinci)

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.3 Language. 

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; learning that is expressed through language requires its own co-parent, although this entry is here because language has so many genres and formal categorizations.

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.4 maintaining the genre, or forming new ones...

##### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2 (genres as vanishing mediators) for learning

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Unlike the co-subsection, as learning is a matter of perfecting the intra-agency relationship, this subsection has only one pair the co-subjection has.  Learning that is not centered on active learning (see 3.2.4.2.2.2.3) are not mentioned in this sub-section as this sub-section focuses on the agencies in relationship to their symbolic.

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2.1 theraoy, diagnosis, hypothesis and experiment

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2.2 developing an industry (jargon)

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2.3 language

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; as learning is also genre vanishing, so learning can also be genre re-inforcing.  This entry is a bit of a paradox, as in this position, one in language would be like that of politics that negates its own activitity.  Nietzsche's last man is at this position, as is Wagner's.  You can also draw a parallel here with Christ, self negating because the next phase will be very differet.  Genres vanish so new genres can rule, perhaps like how Bronze Age narratives contrast with Axial Age narratives.  Axial Age narratives describe a self transcendence, like that of Christ's Heaven on Earth or Marx's Communist Revolution.

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Language is its own event.

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.3 Attention focusing can be thought of as active when the attention is focused on a Deleuzian Encounter.

&emsp; &emsp; Deleuzian encounters are opportunities for us to think.  Should the encounter provoke cognitive dissonance, those feelings would be a sign that maybe we didn't account for all the energies involved.
