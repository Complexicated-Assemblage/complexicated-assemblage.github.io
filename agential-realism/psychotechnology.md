# 3 Psychotechnology

## 3.1 Definition of Pscyhotechnology.

### &emsp; 3.1.1 Attention as Function of Psychotechnology.

    The first two subsections focus on knowledge as fitting a pre-defined type.  The last two subsections consider that knowledge can be of states are not pre-given.

## 3.2 Hyperreality as Epistemology.

### &emsp; 3.2.1 Games and the control of context

&emsp; See Background of Non-interference #background

### &emsp; 3.2.2 Industry defined contexts

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.2.1 Games (that people play)

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.2.2 Fan jargon, sub cultures

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.2.3 Sorting types

### &emsp; 3.2.3 Science type domain genres

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.3.1 Big data, sociology

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.3.2 science expertiments and hypothesis.  See Deleuzian encounter; could repeat circular...

### &emsp; 3.2.4 Epistemology and Attention focusing

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.1 Wisdom, Vervaeke to Heidegger (opposite of 3.2.1)

#### &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2 Requires Genres (including 3.2.2)

##### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1 genre as baseline for sense/ narratives and forms.

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The first half involves the agencies of the intra-agencies (performance and experimentation) require some mastery of craftsmanship.  But the second half (language and genre forming) are centered on the symbolic layer for determining the direction of development.

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.1 performance arts, the media... social media where genre opens up to other agencies...

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.2 experimental art, craftsmanship (da vinci)

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.3 Language. 

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; learning that is expressed through language requires its own co-parent, although this entry is here because language has so many genres and formal categorizations.

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.1.4 maintaining the genre, or forming new ones...

##### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2 (genres as vanishing mediators) for learning

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Unlike the co-subsection, as learning is a matter of perfecting the intra-agency relationship, this subsection has only one pair the co-subjection has.  Learning that is not centered on active learning (see 3.2.4.2.2.2.3) are not mentioned in this sub-section.

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2.1 theraoy, diagnosis, hypothesis and experiment

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2.2 developing an industry (jargon)

###### &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3.2.4.2.2.3 language

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; as learning is also genre vanishing, so learning can also be genre re-inforcing.  This entry is a bit of a paradox, as in this position, one in language would be like that of politics that negates its own activitity.  Nietzsche's last man is at this position, as is Wagner's.
